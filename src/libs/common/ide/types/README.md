# Core IDE types

This directory contains the core IDE types used throughout the cursorless code base. Note that a lot of the types as well as their JSDocs were taken and modified from the core vscode types, which are available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).
