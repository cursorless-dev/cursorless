/**
 * Selects a hat for a given token from amongst {@link candidates}, trading off
 * hat quality and hat stability
 *
 * **IMPORTANT**: This function assumes that all tokens with a lower rank than
 * the given token have already been assigned hats.
 *
 * We proceed as follows:
 *
 * 1. Decide whether to keep our own hat, if a higher ranked token hasn't
 *    already taken it
 * 2. Decide whether to steal a hat from a lower ranked token
 *
 * See [hat assignment](../../../docs/user/hatAssignment.md) for more info.
 *
 * TODO: Could be improved by ignoring subsequent tokens that also contain
 * another character that can be used with lower color. To compute that, look at
 * all the other characters in the given su  Ã¥bsequent token, look at their
 * current color, and add the number of times it appears in between the current
 * token and the given subsequent token.
 *
 * Here is an example where the existing algorithm falls down: "ab ax b"
 *
 * @param context Lookup tables with information about which graphemes / hats
 * other tokens have
 * @param hatStability The user settings that determine when to keep / steal
 * hats
 * @param tokenRank The rank of the token for whom we're picking a hat
 * @param oldTokenHat The hat that was on the token before (or `undefined` if it
 * didn't have one)
 * @param candidates The set of candidate hats under consideration (includes
 * both hat style and grapheme)
 * @returns
