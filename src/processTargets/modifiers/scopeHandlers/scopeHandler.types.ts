/**
 * Represents a scope type.  The functions in this interface allow us to find
 * specific instances of the given scope type in a document.  For example, there
 * is a function to find the scopes touching a given position
 * ({@link getScopesTouchingPosition}), a function to find every instance of
 * the scope overlapping a range ({@link getScopesOverlappingRange}), etc.
 * These functions are used by the various modifier stages to implement
 * modifiers that involve the given scope type, such as containing, every,
 * next, etc.
 *
 * Note that some scope types are hierarchical, ie one scope of the given type
 * can contain another scope of the same type.  For example, a function can
 * contain other functions, so functions are hierarchical.  Surrounding pairs
 * are also hierarchical, as they can be nested.  Many scope types are not
 * hierarchical, though, eg line, token, word, etc.
 *
 * In the case of a hierarchical scope type, these functions should never
 * return two scopes that contain one another.  Ie if we return a surrounding
 * pair, we shouldn't also return any surrounding pairs contained within, or
 * if we return a function, we shouldn't also return a function nested within
 * that function.
 *
 * Note that there are helpers that can sometimes be used to avoid implementing
 * a scope handler from scratch, eg {@link NestedScopeHandler}.
