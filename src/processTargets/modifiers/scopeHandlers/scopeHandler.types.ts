/**
 * Represents a scope type.  The functions in this interface allow us to find
 * specific instances of the given scope type in a document. These functions are
 * used by the various modifier stages to implement modifiers that involve the
 * given scope type, such as containing, every, next, etc.
 *
 * Note that some scope types are hierarchical, ie one scope of the given type
 * can contain another scope of the same type.  For example, a function can
 * contain other functions, so functions are hierarchical.  Surrounding pairs
 * are also hierarchical, as they can be nested.  Many scope types are not
 * hierarchical, though, eg line, token, word, etc.
 *
 * Note also that scope's domains are never allowed to partially overlap.
 * Scopes can be directly adjacent to one another, or have one or more
 * characters between them, or, for hierarchical scopes, one scope can
 * completely contain another scope.
 *
 * Note that there are helpers that can sometimes be used to avoid implementing
 * a scope handler from scratch, eg {@link NestedScopeHandler}.
