# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Cursorless is still pre-1.0, and users are expected to use the latest version, so security vulnerabilities are only patched on the latest version. If you would like security patches on an older version, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/discussions/new).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the GitHub private security vulnerability [reporting system](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/security/advisories/new).
