# Algolia config

This directory contains the configuration for the algolia crawler and index settings.

Unfortunately, today, the source of truth lives in the Algolia web console, but in the future, we'd like to use these files as the source of truth and deploy them to Algolia in CI. See #917.

For information on tweaking how we crawl and index our docs, see [Documentation search](../../../docs/contributing/documentation-search.md)
