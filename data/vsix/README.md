Used in the rare case an extension required for the development environment is not present on the OpenVSX Marketplace (or the VSCode Marketplace, though that is far less likely).

As such, `.vsix` files in this directory are included in the git repository. **Make sure the extension license permits redistribution before adding it to this directory, and include a copy of the license!**
