  /**
   * Runs a Cursorless command. We proceed as follows:
   *
   * 1. Perform inference on targets to fill in details left out using things
   *    like previous targets. For example we would automatically infer that
   *    `"take funk air and bat"` is equivalent to `"take funk air and funk
   *    bat"`. See {@link inferFullTargets} for details of how this is done.
   * 2. Call {@link processTargets} to map each abstract {@link Target} object
   *    to a concrete list of {@link Target} objects.
   * 3. Run the requested action on the given selections. The mapping from
   *    action id (eg `remove`) to implementation is defined in {@link Actions}.
   *    To understand how actions work, see some examples, such as `"take"`
   *    {@link SetSelection} and `"chuck"` {@link Delete}. See
   * 4. Update `source` and `that` marks, if they have been returned from the
   *    action, and returns the desired return value indicated by the action, if
   *    it has one.
