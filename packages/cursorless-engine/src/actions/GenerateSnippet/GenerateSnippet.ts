/**
 * This action can be used to automatically create a snippet from a target. Any
 * cursor selections inside the target will become placeholders in the final
 * snippet.  This action creates a new file, and inserts a snippet that the user
 * can fill out to construct their desired snippet.
 *
 * Note that there are two snippets involved in this implementation:
 *
 * - The snippet that the user is trying to create.  We refer to this snippet as
 *   the user snippet.
 * - The snippet that we insert that the user can use to build their snippet. We
 *   refer to this as the meta snippet.
 *
 * We proceed as follows:
 *
 * 1. Ask user for snippet name if not provided as arg
 * 2. Find all cursor selections inside target - these will become the user
 *    snippet variables
 * 3. Extract text of target
 * 4. Replace cursor selections in text with random ids that won't be affected
 *    by json serialization.  After serialization we'll replace these id's by
 *    snippet placeholders.
 * 4. Construct the user snippet body as a list of strings
 * 5. Construct a javascript object that will be json-ified to become the meta
 *    snippet
 * 6. Serialize the javascript object to json
 * 7. Perform replacements on the random id's appearing in this json to get the
 *    text we desire.  This modified json output is the meta snippet.
 * 8. Open a new document in user custom snippets dir to hold the new snippet.
 * 9. Insert the meta snippet so that the user can construct their snippet.
 *
 * Note that we avoid using JS interpolation strings here because the syntax is
 * very similar to snippet placeholders, so we would end up with lots of
 * confusing escaping.
