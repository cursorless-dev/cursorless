 * A component of a spoken form used internally during spoken form generation.

 * `LiteralSpokenFormComponent` and `SpokenFormComponent[]` with something like
 * `SequenceSpokenFormComponent`. We'd also like to avoid throwing
 * `NoSpokenFormError` and instead return a `SpokenFormComponent` that
 * represents an error. This would allow us to localize errors and still render
 * the remainder of the spoken form component.
