   * {@link Range.end|end} is equal to or after {@link position} in document
   * order.
   *
   * If your scope type is *not* hierarchical, and {@link direction} is
   * `"backward"`, yield all scopes whose {@link TargetScope.domain|domain}'s
   * {@link Range.start|start} is equal to or before {@link position}, in
   * reverse document order.
   *
   * If your scope type *is* hierarchical, and {@link direction} is `"forward"`,
   * walk forward starting at {@link position} (including position). Any time a
   * scope's {@link TargetScope.domain|domain} ends or starts, yield that scope.
   * If multiple domains start or end at a particular point, break ties as
   * follows:
   *
   * 1. First yield any scopes with empty domain.
   * 2. Then yield any scopes whose domains are ending, in reverse order of
   *    where they start.
   * 3. Then yield the scope with minimal domain that is starting. Any time you
   *    yield a scope, advance your position to the end of the scope, but when
   *    considering this new position, don't return this scope again.
   *
   * If your scope type *is* hierarchical, and {@link direction} is
   * `"backward"`, walk backward starting at {@link position} (including
   * position). Any time a scope's {@link TargetScope.domain|domain} ends or
   * starts, yield that scope. If multiple domains start or end at a particular
   * point, break ties as follows:
   *
   * 1. First yield any scopes with empty domain.
   * 2. Then yield any scopes whose domains are starting, in order of where they

   *    yield a scope, advance your position to the start of the scope, but when
   *    considering this new position, don't return this scope again.
   *
   * Note that the {@link hints} argument can be ignored, but you are welcome to
   * use it to improve performance.  For example, knowing the
   * {@link ScopeIteratorRequirements.distalPosition} can be useful if you need
   * to query a list of scopes in bulk.
   *
   * Some notes:
   *
   * - Once you have yielded a scope, you do not need to yield any scopes
   *   contained by that scope.
   * - You can yield the same scope more than once if it makes your life easier
   *
   * The only strict requirements are that
   *
   * - you yield every scope that might meet the requirements
   * - you yield scopes in the correct order
   *
   * @param editor The editor containing {@link position}
   * @param position The position from which to start
   * @param direction The direction to go relative to {@link position}
   * @param hints Optional hints about which scopes should be returned
