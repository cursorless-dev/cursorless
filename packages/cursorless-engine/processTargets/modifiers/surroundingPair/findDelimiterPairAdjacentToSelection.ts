/**
 * Looks for a surrounding pair where one of its delimiters contains the entire selection.
 *
 * @param initialIndex The index of the first delimiter to try within the delimiter occurrences list.  Expected to be
 * the index of the first delimiter whose end offset is greater than or equal to
 * the end offset of the selection.
 * @param delimiterOccurrences A list of delimiter occurrences.  Expected to be sorted by offsets
 * @param selectionOffsets The offsets of the selection
 * @param bailOnUnmatchedAdjacent If `true`, immediately return null if we find
 * an adjacent delimiter that we can't find a match for.  This variable will
 * be true if the current iteration can't see the full document.  In that
 * case, we'd like to fail and let a subsequent pass try again in case
 * the matching delimiter is outside the range we're looking.
 * @returns The offsets of a surrounding pair, one of whose delimiters is
 * adjacent to or containing the selection.  Returns `null` if such a pair
 * can't be found in the given list of delimiter occurrences.
