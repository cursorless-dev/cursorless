## {meta.description}

Cursorless is an open-source spoken language for editing code, enabling users to write software entirely by voice faster than with a keyboard and mouse. Software engineers can code using high-level semantic manipulations (increased productivity), and all computer users can reduce strain on their wrists to prevent injury (preventative healthcare).

## Cursorless development is user-led

Your support will help Cursorless founder, Pokey Rule, and his team develop the following feature requests as quickly as possible:

- Reduce the learning curve with interactive tutorials, videos, and documentation to increase the rate of adoption.
- Launch Cursorless in other IDEs, such as JetBrains, emacs, etc, as well as in a web browser, and even work globally using OCR / accessibility APIs to operate anywhere on the screen.
- Further improvements to the Cursorless execution engine to advance the state of the art in voice coding.

  "This extension is a genuine game-changer. As someone who suffers with chronic
  RSI, I was seriously concerned I would be unfit to continue my career
  long-term. Discovering Talon and Cursorless has given me hope again and has
  additionally given me the means to write code and interface with my computer
  in ways I never thought possible. It's also made coding way more fun than
  before! I often feel like a code-slinging wizard!"

"For developers turning to Talon due to typing limitations, Cursorless isn’t just beneficial—it’s indispensable. When I lost my ability to type due to RSI, I was consumed with the fear of significantly reduced productivity and potentially not being able to work anymore. However, when I discovered Cursorless, it gave me hope and confidence that I could regain my prior efficiency once I mastered the tool."

"This is fantastic extension that is not only saving my career but is even speeding up my workflow within VS Code more than when I was typing anyway. The best part is you really feel like a hacker when you rattle off a long command and the code does exactly what you wanted!"
