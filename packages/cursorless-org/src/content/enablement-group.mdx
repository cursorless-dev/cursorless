## {meta.description}

Cursorless, an open-source spoken language for editing code, enables users to write software entirely by voice faster than with a keyboard and mouse. Software engineers can code using high-level semantic manipulations (increased productivity), and all computer users can reduce strain on their wrists to prevent injury (preventative healthcare).

Cursorless development is user-led. Your support will help Cursorless founder, Pokey Rule, and his team develop the following feature requests as quickly as possible:

- Reduce the learning curve with interactive tutorials, videos, and documentation to increase the rate of adoption.
- Launch Cursorless in other IDEs, such as JetBrains, emacs, etc, as well as in a web browser, and even work globally using OCR / accessibility APIs to operate anywhere on the screen.
- Further improvements to the Cursorless execution engine to advance the state of the art in voice coding.

### üéØ Goals

Cursorless needs a dedicated, full-time software engineer on staff. This will cost $5,000 USD per month. The Enablement Group guides development and the participation fees contribute to this crucial funding. Cursorless will always be open source.
