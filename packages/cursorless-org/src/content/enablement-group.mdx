## {meta.description}

Cursorless, an open-source spoken language for editing code, enables users to write software entirely by voice faster than with a keyboard and mouse. Software engineers can code using high-level semantic manipulations (increased productivity), and all computer users can reduce strain on their wrists to prevent injury (preventative healthcare).

## Cursorless development is user-led

Your support will help Cursorless founder, Pokey Rule, and his team develop the following feature requests as quickly as possible:

- Reduce the learning curve with interactive tutorials, videos, and documentation to increase the rate of adoption.
- Launch Cursorless in other IDEs, such as JetBrains, emacs, etc, as well as in a web browser, and even work globally using OCR / accessibility APIs to operate anywhere on the screen.
- Further improvements to the Cursorless execution engine to advance the state of the art in voice coding.

"This extension is truly game changing for programming using your voice. Talon
along with this extension have allowed me to keep my job as a software
developer and stay at a competitive level of productivity despite chronic pain
in both of my hands. If you want to you can literally program without using
your hands at all!

Even if you still use your hands some of the features of
Cursorless allow you to edit and refactor existing code in faster and more
intuitive ways than are possible with a mouse and keyboard."

"For developers turning to Talon due to typing limitations, Cursorless isn’t just beneficial—it’s indispensable. When I lost my ability to type due to RSI, I was consumed with the fear of significantly reduced productivity and potentially not being able to work anymore. However, when I discovered Cursorless, it gave me hope and confidence that I could regain my prior efficiency once I mastered the tool."

  "This extension is a genuine game-changer. As someone who suffers with chronic
  RSI, I was seriously concerned I would be unfit to continue my career
  long-term. Discovering Talon and Cursorless has given me hope again and has
  additionally given me the means to write code and interface with my computer
  in ways I never thought possible. It's also made coding way more fun than
  before! I often feel like a code-slinging wizard!"
