# Release Notes for 1.0.0

_Published March 4, 2025_

## Preamble

Cursorless is finally ready for its 1.0 release! ðŸŽ‰

Over the last year, the Cursorless team has focused primarily on improving the user experience and migrating legacy language scopes. During 2024 we merged [299 PRs](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pulls?q=merged%3A2024+sort%3Aupdated-asc+) and so far during 2025 [100+ PRs](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pulls?q=merged%3A2025+sort%3Aupdated-asc+). We are now at a point where we feel Cursorless is ready for its first official release.

## The subject at hand

Here are the highlights of what we've accomplished:

### Improved user experience

- Added a Cursorless tutorial in VSCode to help new users get started quickly ([#360](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/360), [#2543](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/2543), [#2525](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/2525))
- Simplified the installation process by notifying users if they're missing essential features like Talon or the command server ([#2720](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/2720), [#2061](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pull/2061))

## ðŸ“ˆ What's next?

- We will continue to improve language definitions. There are still some languages where features are missing or still in legacy form
- Improving documentation. This is an area where we would really appreciate [contributions](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation)
- Cursorless everywhere. We now have users working on Cursorless for multiple new editors. The future for Cursorless everywhere is looking very bright

We'd like to end with a massive thank you to [our sponsors ðŸŽ‰](https://github.com/sponsors/pokey), without whom Cursorless development would not be possible!
