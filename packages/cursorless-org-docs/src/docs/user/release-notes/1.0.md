# Release Notes for 1.0

_Published March 4, 2025_

## Preamble

Cursorless is finally ready for its 1.0 release! ðŸŽ‰

Over the last year, the Cursorless team has focused primarily on improving the user experience and migrating legacy language scopes. During 2024 we merged [299 PRs](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pulls?q=merged%3A2024+sort%3Aupdated-asc+) and so far during 2025 [100+ PRs](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/pulls?q=merged%3A2025+sort%3Aupdated-asc+). We are now at a point where we feel Cursorless is ready for its first official release.

## The subject at hand

Here are the highlights of what we've accomplished:

### Improved user experience

- Added a Cursorless tutorial in VSCode to help new users get started quickly
- Simplified the installation process by notifying users if they're missing essential features like Talon or the command server
- Improved error messages and feedback throughout the extension

### Next-gen scope definitions

- Migrated all text-based scopes and most language-specific ones from our legacy definitions to next-gen scope definitions
- You can now use more natural commands like `"take two items"` and work with collection scopes
- Added support for more programming languages, with continued improvements to existing ones

### Community integration

- Deprecated the Cursorless snippets in favor of the [community snippets](https://github.com/talonhub/community/tree/f7e5f9696c7ed6e78e8488c8b7fb1c6bbcc25779/core/snippets)
- Improved integration with Talon and other voice coding tools

### Stability and testing

- We now have over 10,000 tests in total, testing everything from actions and scopes to the Talon grammar
- Significantly improved stability and performance across the board
- Fixed numerous bugs and edge cases reported by users

### New features

- Added more actions, modifiers, and scope types
- Extended language support to cover more programming paradigms
- Improved visualizations and feedback for Cursorless commands

## ðŸ“ˆ What's next?

- We will continue to improve language definitions. There are still some languages where features are missing or still in legacy form
- Improving documentation. This is an area where we would really appreciate [contributions](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocumentation)
- Cursorless everywhere. We now have users working on Cursorless for multiple new editors. The future for Cursorless everywhere is looking very bright

We'd like to end with a massive thank you to [our sponsors ðŸŽ‰](https://github.com/sponsors/pokey), without whom Cursorless development would not be possible!
