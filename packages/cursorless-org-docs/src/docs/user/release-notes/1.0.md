# Release Notes for 1.0

Cursorless if finally ready for its 1.0 release!

Over the last year the Cursorless team has focused primarily on the user experience and migrating legacy language scopes. We are now at a point where we feel Cursorless is ready for its first official release.

Here are a few highlights of the things we have done / achieved:

- Added a Cursorless tutorial in vscode
- Simplify the installation process by notifying a user if they are missing essential features like Talon or the command server.
- Migrated all the text based scopes and most of the language specific ones from our old legacy definitions to use tree sitter queries. You can now say things like `"take two items"`.
- Deprecated the Cursorless snippets in favor of the community snippets
- We now have over 10000! tests in total. Testing everything from actions and scopes to the Talon grammar.
- We have also added more actions, modifiers, scopes support for more languages, fixed bugs and so on.
