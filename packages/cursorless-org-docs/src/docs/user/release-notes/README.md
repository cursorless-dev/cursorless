# Release notes

Here we gather "release notes" with new Cursorless features, bug fixes, and improvements. Note that Cursorless is on continuous delivery, so these "releases" are just a way to highlight features that you already have, but might not have noticed ðŸ˜Š.

Note that these release notes come out very occasionally, so if you want to know what we've been up to between releases, you can check out our raw changelog entries, which are stored in [markdown blurbs in our monorepo](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/tree/main/changelog). In the future, we'll generate proper release notes from these blurbs. Until then, you'll have to use your imagination or wait for us to hand-write release notes.
