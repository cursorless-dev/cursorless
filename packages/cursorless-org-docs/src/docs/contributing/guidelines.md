# Contributor guidelines

## Pull request comments

Any pull request comment should either be

- addressed in code and optionally resolved, or
- replied to.

Specifically, a PR author should not resolve a comment if they haven't made any code changes in response to the comment.

An exception is comments that begin with `note: `.
