At long last, collection items have been migrated to our next generation scope framework! This means, within a list of items, you can now use relative navigation (`previous item`), absolute navigation via ordinals (`fifth item`), multiple selection (`two items`, optionally preceded with `previous` or `next`), and lastly, requesting multiple items to be individually selected via `every` (`every two items`)!
