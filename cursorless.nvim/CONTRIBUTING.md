# Contributing

Welcome! So glad you've decided to help make Cursorless in Neovim better.

Note that Cursorless is maintained as a monorepo, hosted at [`cursorless`](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless), and the source of truth for all of the files here lives there, so that's where you'll want to file a PR. We automatically deploy from our monorepo to the [cursorless.nvim repo](https://github.com/hands-free-vim/cursorless.nvim) in CI.

See [the Cursorless neovim contributor docs](https://www.cursorless.org/docs/contributing/cursorless-in-neovim/) to get started.
