# Command server

This directory contains a minified version of a `command-server`, which enables us to communicate with node from Talon. It is based on [command-server we use for VSCode](https://github.com/pokey/command-server/), but modified to run in a Neovim node subprocess. It can be built by following the instructions from https://github.com/hands-free-vim/command-server/tree/neovim#build
