;; What should map and list refer to in Go programs?
;;
;; The obvious answer is that map should refer to map and struct composite literals,
;; and that list should refer to slice and array composite literals.
;;
;; There are two problems with this answer.
;;
;;   * The type of a composite literal is a semantic, not a syntactic property of a program.
;;       - What is the type of T{1: 2}? It could be array, map, or slice.
;;       - What about T{a: 1}? It could be map or struct.
;;       - What about T{1, 2}? It could be struct, array, or slice.
;;     Cursorless only has syntactic information available to it.
;;
;;   * The user might not know the type either. With a named type, the type definition might be far away.
;;     Or it might just be offscreen. Either way, the user needs to be able to make a decision about
;;     what scope to use using only locally available, syntactic information.
;;     Note that this also means that has-a predicates work better than has-no predicates.
;;     The user can locally confirm that there is a keyed element.
;;     She cannot confirm locally that there is no keyed element; it might just not be visible.
;;
;; Combining all these constraints suggests the following simple rules:
;;
;;   * If there is a keyed element present, then it is a map.
;;   * If there is a non-keyed element present, then it is a list.
;;   * If there are both or neither, then it is both a map and a list.
;;
;; Conveniently, this is also simple to implement.
;;
;; This guarantees that a user always knows how to refer to any composite literal.
;; There are cases in which being overgenerous in matching is not ideal,
;; but they are rarer, so let's optimize for the common case.
;; Mixed keyed and non-keyed elements are also rare in practice.
;; The main ambiguity is with {}, but there's little we can do about that.
;;
;; Go users also expect that the map and list scopes will include the type definition,
;; as well as any & before the type. (Strictly speaking it is not part of the literal,
;; but that's not how most humans think about it.)
;;
;; If you are considering changing the map and list scopes, take a look at the examples in
;; data/playground/go/maps_and_lists.go, which cover a fairly wide variety of cases.
