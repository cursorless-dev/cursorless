# Cursorless internals

This document is intended to present a high-level overview of the Cursorless
architecture, as well as key pointers to locations in the code base to help
contributors get up to speed.

For the time being, we recommend watching the [internals walk-through
videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkafpFOBVedScHi0dy_80DsHwnZIOSOTy)
and having a look through the API docs, starting from the [`runCommand`
function](modules/cursorless_engine_src_runCommand).
