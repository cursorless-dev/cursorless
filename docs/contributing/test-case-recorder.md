# Test case recorder

We use an automated test case recorder to generate test cases. To use it, you
set up a file the way you'd like (usually a minimal file containing something
like `hello world`), positioning your cursor where you want, tell cursorless to
start recording, and then issue one or more cursorless commands. It works by
recording the initial state of the file including cursor position(s), the
command run, and the final state, all in the form of a yaml document. See
[existing test cases](../../src/test/suite/fixtures/recorded) for example outputs.

## Initial setup

Add a voice command for recording to your personal talon files:

```talon
cursorless record: user.vscode("cursorless.recordTestCase")
```

We don't want to commit this so please add it to your own Talon user file set.

### Configuring the test case Recorder

The test case recorder has several additional configuration options. The default configuration works for most tests, but you may find the following useful.

#### Testing the hat map

We have a way to test that the hats in the hat map update correctly during the course of a single phrase. These tests are also how we usually test our [range updating code](../api/modules/core_updateSelections_updateSelections).

Please add the following to your personal talon files:

- https://github.com/pokey/pokey_talon/blob/9298c25dd6d28fd9fcf5ed39f305bc6b93e5f229/apps/vscode/vscode.talon#L468
- https://github.com/pokey/pokey_talon/blob/49643bfa8f62cbec18b5ddad1658f5a28785eb01/apps/vscode/vscode.py#L203-L205

It is quite unlikely you'll need this second step. Most tests don't check the navigation map.

#### Capturing errors

We support recording tests where the expected result is an error

Please add a command to your personal talon files. See the two files links above for context. Add the command below to your to your `vscode.py` and ensure that there is a matching Talon command.

```
  actions.user.vscode_with_plugin("cursorless.recordTestCase", {"recordErrors": True})
```

#### Testing decoration highlights

We support testing our decoration highlights, eg the flash of red when something is deleted. If you'd like to be able to record tests which check our decoration highlights, please add another command to your personal talon files. See the two files links above for context. Add the command below to your to your `vscode.py` and ensure that there is a matching Talon command.

```
  actions.user.vscode_with_plugin("cursorless.recordTestCase", {"isDecorationsTest": True})
```

## Recording new tests

1. Start debugging (F5)
1. Create a minimal file to use for recording tests. And position your cursor
   where you'd like. Check out the `initialState.documentContents` field of
   [existing test cases](../../src/test/suite/fixtures/recorded) for examples.
1. Issue the `"cursorless record"` command
   - List of target directories is shown. All test cases will be put into the
     given subdirectory of `src/test/suite/fixtures/recorded`
1. Select existing directory or create new one
   - Select `Create new folder`
   - If the new directory name contains any `/`, it will create nested
     subdirectories.
1. `Recording test cases for following commands` is shown
1. Issue any cursorless voice command
   - `"take air"`
1. `Cursorless test case saved` is shown
   - File created on disk using spoken words as file name
1. Repeat as many cursorless voice commands as you want recorded. Each command
   you
   issue will generate a test case in the form of a yaml file.
1. Issue `"cursorless record"` command again to stop recording
   - `Stopped recording test cases` is shown
   - You can also just stop the debugger or close the debug window

### Navigation map tests

If you want to check how the navigation map gets updated in response to changes, you can instead say "cursorless record navigation", and then you need to issue two commands in one phrase each time. The second command should be of the form "take air" (or another decorated mark), and will tell the test case recorder which decorated mark we're checking.

## Run recorded tests

Recorded tests will automatically be picked up and run with the normal tests,
and can be run in vscode or via yarn in terminal.

## Changing recorded test cases in bulk

### Autoformatting

To clean up the formatting of all of the yaml test cases, run `yarn run compile && node ./out/scripts/transformRecordedTests/index.js`

### Upgrading fixtures

To upgrade all the test fixtures to the latest command version, run the command `yarn run compile && node ./out/scripts/transformRecordedTests/index.js upgrade`. This command should be idempotent.

### Custom transformation

1. Add a new transformation to the `src/scripts/transformRecordedTests/transformations` directory. Look at the existing transformations in that directory for inspiration.
1. Change the value at the `custom` key in `AVAILABLE_TRANSFORMATIONS` at the top of
   [`transformRecordedTests/index.ts`](../../src/scripts/transformRecordedTests/index.ts) to
   point to your new transformation
1. Run `yarn run compile && node ./out/scripts/transformRecordedTests/index.js custom`

Example of a custom transformation

```typescript
export function updateSurroundingPairTest(fixture: TestCaseFixture) {
  fixture.command.targets = transformPartialPrimitiveTargets(
    fixture.command.targets,
    (target: PartialPrimitiveTargetDesc) => {
      target.modifiers?.forEach((modifier) => {
        if (modifier?.type === "surroundingPair") {
          let delimiterInclusion: DelimiterInclusion;
          switch (modifier.delimiterInclusion as any) {
            case "includeDelimiters":
              delimiterInclusion = undefined;
              break;
            case "excludeDelimiters":
              delimiterInclusion = "interiorOnly";
              break;
            case "delimitersOnly":
              delimiterInclusion = "excludeInterior";
              break;
          }
          modifier.delimiterInclusion = delimiterInclusion;
        }
      });
```
