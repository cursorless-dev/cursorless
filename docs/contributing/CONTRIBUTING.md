# Contributing

Welcome! So glad you've decided to help make Cursorless better. You'll want to start by getting [set up](#initial-setup) and learning how to [run / test a local copy of the
extension](#running--testing-extension-locally). You may also find the [VSCode API docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) helpful to learn about VSCode extension development.

## Initial setup

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/); minimum version for local development is 1.72.0 in order to support settings profiles for sandboxed development. Please file an issue if that is a problem.

### Steps

1. Clone [`cursorless`](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless)
2. Open the newly created `cursorless` directory in VSCode. If you're on Windows, don't use WSL (see [#919](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/issues/919) for discussion / workaround).
3. Run the following in the terminal:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm compile
   ```

4. Run

   ```bash
   code --profile=cursorlessDevelopment
   ```

   and then close the window that opens (eg say `"window close"`). This step is necessary to create the [VSCode settings profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_settings-profiles) that acts as a sandbox containing a specific set of VSCode extensions that will be run alongside Cursorless when you launch Cursorless in debug or test mode. Once https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/172046 is resolved, we will be able to remove this step, as the profile can then automatically be created.

5. Run the following in the terminal:

   ```bash
   pnpm init-vscode-sandbox
   ```

   The `pnpm init-vscode-sandbox` command creates a local [VSCode settings profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_settings-profiles) that acts as a sandbox containing a specific set of VSCode extensions that will be run alongside Cursorless when you launch Cursorless in debug or test mode. This approach is [suggested](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_extension-debugging-in-a-clean-environment) by the VSCode documentation. If you need to update any of the extension dependencies in the sandbox, you can add `--force` to the command. If you'd like to use additional extensions when debugging locally, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   code --profile=cursorlessDevelopment --install-extension some.extension
   ```

   where `some.extension` is the id of the extension you'd like to install into the sandbox

6. Copy / symlink `cursorless-talon-dev` into your Talon user directory for some useful voice commands for developing Cursorless.

## Running / testing extension locally

In order to test out your local version of the extension or to run unit tests
locally, you need to run the extension in debug mode. To do so you need to run
the `workbench.action.debug.selectandstart` command in VSCode and then select either "Run
Extension" or "Extension Tests".

### Running a subset of tests

The entire test suite takes a little while to run (1-2 mins), so you may want to run just a subset of the tests.

To specify the set of tests to run, say `"debug generate subset"`, or if you haven't installed the cursorless-talon-dev files, run the VSCode task "Generate test subset file". To do this, choose "Tasks: Run Task" from the command pallete.

To run the specified subset of tests, use the "Run test subset" launch config instead of the usual "Extension Tests".

If you need to edit the subset of tests to run in the future, you can say `"debug edit subset"`.

## Code formatting

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate autoformatting.
Autoformatters will automatically run on PRs in CI, but you can also run them
locally or install pre-commit hooks as described in the
[`pre-commit` documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Running docs site locally

Run the `workbench.action.debug.selectandstart` command and then select
"Docusaurus Start (Debug)".

## Adding tests

See [test-case-recorder.md](./test-case-recorder.md).

It is also possible to write manual tests. When doing so, we have a convention that any test that must be run within a VSCode context (eg because it imports `"vscode"`), should be placed in a file with the suffix `.vscode.test.ts`. All other tests should end with just `.test.ts`. This allows us to run non-VSCode tests locally outside of VSCode using the `Run unit tests` launch config. These tests run much faster than the full VSCode test suite.

## Parse tree support

### Adding a new programming language

See [docs](./adding-a-new-language.md).

### Adding syntactic scope types to an existing language

See [parse-tree-patterns.md](./parse-tree-patterns.md).

### Testing Cursorless with a local version of the VSCode parse tree extension

First bundle the parse tree extension into a `.vsix`, using something like the following:

```
cd ../vscode-parse-tree
vsce package -o bundle.vsix
```

Once you have your package then you can install it into the sandbox using the following command:

```
code --profile=cursorlessDevelopment --install-extension bundle.vsix
```

## Installing a local build of the Cursorless extension

You can install a local build of the Cursorless extension by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm -F cursorless-vscode install-local
```

This will bundle and install a local version of Cursorless, uninstalling production Cursorless first and using a special extension id to break the update chain.

If you don't want to have to check out the PR and do the build yourself, you can
use `install-from-pr` instead, and pass a PR number to the command and it will
download and install the artifact from the PR build. This requires the [`gh`
cli](https://cli.github.com/). For example:

```bash
pnpm -F cursorless-vscode install-from-pr 1281
```

To uninstall the local build and revert to production cursorless, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm -F cursorless-vscode uninstall-local
```

## Changing SVGs

### SVG preprocessing script

You'll probably want to run the following to make sure the SVGs have everything they need:

```sh
pnpm -F @cursorless/cursorless-vscode preprocess-svg-hats
```

This script will add dummy width, height and fill attributes as necessary to appease the regex in `Decorations.ts`

### Adding hat adjustments at finish

While tweaking, the easiest approach is probably to use the
`cursorless.individualHatAdjustments` setting in your settings.json to change
size / alignment so you don't need to refresh every time. Once you're done, you
can paste the settings into `packages/cursorless-vscode/src/scripts/hatAdjustments/add.ts` and run the following to get
your updates:

```sh
pnpm -F @cursorless/cursorless-vscode hat-adjustments-add
```

If instead, you want to average your adjustments with those in main and see the differences to get to yours and main, you can paste the settings into `packages/cursorless-vscode/src/scripts/hatAdjustments/average.ts` and run:

```sh
pnpm -F @cursorless/cursorless-vscode hat-adjustments-average
```
